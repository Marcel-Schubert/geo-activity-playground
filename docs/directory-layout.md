# Directory Layout

There are a bunch of files that need to be given to this set of scripts, are used as intermediate files or generated as output. In order to make it clear where everything is, the following document lists all the paths which are relevant to the script.

Everything is relative to a *base directory* which can be passed with the `--basedir` option to the scripts.

# Input

The user has to put data into the following directories in order for it to be picked up.

- `Strava Export`: Contains the exported data from Strava.

- `config.toml`: Configuration file

# Output

- `Heatmaps`: Will contain heatmap images generated from the data.

# Cache

The following directories serve as a cache. One can inspect this but doesn't need to work with that directly.

- `Open Street Map Tiles`: Cached tiles from the Open Street Map. The substructure is `zoom/x/y.png`. Each image has a size of 256Ã—256 pixels.

- `Strava API`: Everything that is downloaded via the Strava API is stored in this subtree.

    - `Data`: The time series data for each activity as a data frame stored in the Parquet format. Filenames are `2589868806.parquet` with the activity IDs. The column names are the following:

        - `time`
        - `latitude`
        - `longitude`
        - `distance`
        - `altitude` (optional)
        - `heartrate` (optional)

    - `Metadata`: The activity objects from the `stravalib` Python library are stored here as Python pickle objects. The file names are time stamp of the activity start, like `start-1364228189.pickle`.

    - `strava_tokens.json`: Tokens for the Strava API. Contains the *access* and *refresh* tokens.

- `Strava Export Cache`:

    - `Activities`: Same as `Strava API/Data`.
