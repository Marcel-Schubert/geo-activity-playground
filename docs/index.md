Recording all my outside activities with a GPS tracker has led to a pretty big data collection. Using [Strava](https://strava.com/) one can already take a look at this data and have a place to store it. On [Statshunters](https://statshunters.com/) there are some nice analyses of the data, for instance regarding explorer tiles.

This project here provides some additional analyses of the data. It is not meant to be comprehensible, rather just to satisfy my curiosity.
