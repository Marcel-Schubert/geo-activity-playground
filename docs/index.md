I like to be outside and I like to record my outdoor activities with a GPX tracker. So far I have kept all my data with [Strava](https://strava.com/) and did some analyses there and also with [Statshunters](https://statshunters.com/). This is already pretty nice.

There are some things which they don't offer, so I want to have a place to implement them. Also I want to support the option of using only local data. This makes this project attractive for people who have a stash of GPX or FIT files but no nice way to analyze their data.

The goal of this project is to import data either from local GPX/FIT files or the Strava API and provide some interesting insights into the data.

You can [find the code on GitHub](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground) where you can also file issues. If you would like to use this yourself or contribute, feel free to reach out via the contact options [from my website](https://martin-ueding.de/). I would especially appreciate improvements to the documentation. If you're familiar with Markdown and GitHub, you can also directly create a pull request.

This documentation strives to follow the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for documentation. In the left sidebar you will find four types of documentation:

- _Tutorials_ will guide you through something with more detail and background, but they won't necessarily do exactly what you need but something similar.
- _How-to guides_ will tell you how to solve a particular problem.
- _Explanations_ will give you background knowledge and a high-level understanding.
- _References_ contain some technical details that might be interesting.

This project is still in a early prototyping phase, I'm still changing a lot and some fundamental decisions are still not finally settled. So please keep in mind that it is all pretty brittle.
